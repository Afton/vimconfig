# vimconfig
My vim config files

No seriously. I've been using Vim for too long without paying much attention to the plugin world.

I'm using github to share across machines. 

Things for me to remember if I start a new machine
make a link from %userprofile%\_vimrc to %userprofile%\path\to\vimconfig\_vimrc
and from %userprofile%\vimfiles to %userprofile%\path\to\vimconfig\vimfiles
